# SendIt

Group Members: Matthew Putra, Brandon Ly, Saksham Aggarwal, Khoa Luong

## Project Description

Sending packages to friends and family can take a lot of time, especially in the city where services like USPS or UPS can experience a lot of backup and the overall process can be a pain. Our target audience is anyone who wants to send packages within close distance but doesnâ€™t want to have to wait days for it to arrive, even when the destination is relatively close. **SendIt** creates a platform where people can send packages to others within reasonably fast times (i.e. send a package to Maple Hall from McMahon Hall). SendIt customers can send packages by filling in an order form, and SendIt drivers can accept the order and complete it.
